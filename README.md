In this article we are going to program our Micro:bit to control the light meassures in Python. Firstly we are goint to code with the light sensor of Micro:bit. This sensor works whith the matrix of leds that's why the light can provoce a voltage in the leds and in this device we have 25 leds to read this information. The issue is that this sensor only can read direct light.
If we want to make a analog lectura using a analog pin, we can use pin0,1,2
Next you can see the Micro:bit pinout

This is an example of Micro:bit and ldr wiring
