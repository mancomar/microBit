In this article, we are going to program our Micro:bit to measure light using Python. First, we will work with the Micro:bit's light sensor. This sensor uses the matrix of LEDs, which can generate a voltage based on the light exposure. The Micro:bit features 25 LEDs to read this information. However, this sensor can only read direct light. If you want to take an analog reading using an analog pin, you can use pins 0, 1, and 2. Below, you can see the Micro:bit pinout.

This is an example of Micro:bit and ldr wiring
